# Car-Price-Prediction
Second hand car price prediction using Neural Network.

## Skills I Learned In This Project :
1. Pandas, numpy.
2. sns module for visualization.
3. Tensors.
4. Building Sequential Neural Network using tensorflows

#### How Features Are related to each othter
1. Diagonal = 'kde'
2. We can see how the price of car decrease with increase in km.

#### Nueral Network : 
1. Used Sequential
2. Input layer for 8 inputs.
3. Normalization layer for normalising (here standardization) of data so that model work faster.
4. Dense layer consisting of neurons (here used relu activation function)
5. Last Dense layer with one output predicting price.

#### Loss :
1. Used MeanAbsoluteError loss
2. Between Train and Validation Data

#### Performance Measure :

1. Used RootMeanSquaredError for performance measurement of model.
2. Between Train and Validation Data
